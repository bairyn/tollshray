-- | FRP: A time-varying function modeled as a self-modifying value.
-- TODO

-- | Composable APIs: messages that time-varying behaviours understand and can
-- respond to.  This is like a composable collection of method declarations in
-- a C++ header file.  Inheritance may be analogized as just another GADT
-- nested struct, but with implicit namespacing to avoid e.g. an extra
-- â€˜.my_implâ€™ layer.
--
-- See also that blog post that showed how type classes like the Monad can be
-- represented as a regular GADT.
--
-- What's cool is this sort of establishes a bridge between FP and OOP: in FRP,
-- you can model time-varying functions as self-modifying functions.  This
-- permits hidden local state, for one.  FRP behaviors can through a composable
-- message API-lke interface, and more.
--
-- Constructors simply instantiate new behaviors, which can implement APIs,
-- like implementing (providing definitions for) C++ header class declarations.
-- Constructors create API implementations and provide the initial behaviour.
-- A constructor ultimately provides the API implementation (like definitions)
-- by producing a behaviour from an API input (symbol and arguments) to an
-- output with a type specified by the API.
--
-- Then you can even use other behaviours (actually, constructors) as blueprint
-- templates that you ca nuse for default implementations with your own manual
-- overrides, although you will likely need knowledge of the internal
-- implementation.

-- The types help inform the Haskell type system what the inputs and outputs
-- are, but strictly speaking aren't necessary needed to encode the structure.
